# Poker-Card-Recognition
Screen scraping mini project conducted to detect bias in PokerStars pocket cards.

NOTE: You might not see any code files attached to this repo. That is because this is a work in progress! More updates to come soon :)

## Intro

I'm a big fan of poker, and my go-to is the PokerStars web app. However, I've been harboring a sneaking suspicion that poker software programs may be incentivized to rig the deck and let the users play bigger hands to make the game more exciting. I wanted to put part of this hypothesis to the test by collecing data about the pocket pairs I receive in PokerStars and seeing if the results match the expected distribution for a truly random deck of cards!

I decided to work in Python for convenience, but even so, I had little idea where to start. After doing a bit of research online, I began to see how to make Python interface with my Mac's screenshot capabilities and file systems, and how to build a script for image recognition. See the sources in the final section for more details.

## Screen Scraping

In poker, every player is dealt two private cards at the start of every round. Here's what it looks like on PokerStar:
